# Music & Studying: A Data Visualization Project

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between music genres, listening platforms, and student concentration during study sessions. Our goal is to understand which auditory environments help improve focus and productivity, and how different platform features may either support or distract students while studying.
By analyzing survey responses, we aim to uncover meaningful patterns and insights about how music impacts academic performance.

## Research Purpose
I seek to answer questions such as:
- Which genres of music best support focus and productivity?
- Are certain platforms (e.g., Spotify, YouTube, Apple Music) more distracting than others?
- How do students’ study habits change with different listening environments?

## Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly) – for data analysis and visualization
- Google Forms / Sheets – for data collection and organization
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code – for analysis and exploration
